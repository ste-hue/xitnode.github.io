# The Function

**xitnode** is a recursive thought transformer—a space where complex ideas get decomposed, simplified, and refined until they reach their atomic essence.

## Core Philosophy

```lisp
(define (think x)
  (if (atomic? x)
      x
      (map think (simplify (decompose x)))))
```

Every thought, no matter how tangled, can be broken down into its essential components. Then simplified. Then processed recursively until what remains is **pure signal**.

## Process

**Input**: Raw thoughts, chaotic observations, half-formed ideas  
**Transform**: Decompose → Simplify → Recurse  
**Output**: Atomic insights you can actually use

## What This Means

- No fluff, no filler
- Every post distills something complex into something **actionable**
- Ideas that **compose** with other ideas
- Thinking patterns over conclusions

## The Name

**exit** + **node** = points of departure that connect to other points of departure. 

Each insight is both an **ending** (of confusion) and a **beginning** (of clarity).
