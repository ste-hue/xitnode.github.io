# Fake Scarcity Lifecycle

_(How industries react when technology makes something abundant)_

1. **Artificial Scarcity Era**
    
    - Production intentionally expensive.
        
    - Supply controlled through physical distribution and licensing.
        
    - Per-unit pricing justified by outdated costs.
        
    
2. **Abundance Shock**
    
    - New tech slashes replication cost to near-zero.
        
    - Barriers vanish (MP3 ripping, torrents, streaming protocols).
        
    - Public realizes the scarcity was manufactured.
        
    
3. **Control Panic**
    
    - **Narrative war**: label adopters as _pirates_, _thieves_, _job killers_.
        
    - **Legal war**: pass restrictive laws (DMCA, DRM, geo-blocks).
        
    - **Litigation war**: sue users, developers, and platforms into compliance.
        
    
4. **Scorched Earth Period**
    
    - Innovation choked or driven underground.
        
    - Industry doubles down on control mechanisms.
        
    - Public sentiment shifts against incumbents.
        
    
5. **Reluctant Adaptation**
    
    - Scarcity replaced with access monetization (Spotify, Netflix).
        
    - Price anchored by convenience, not production cost.
        
    - Gatekeepers survive as curators rather than manufacturers.
        
    
6. **Normalization**
    
    - Abundance becomes the default.
        
    - Control grid shrinks but doesn’t disappear — it adapts.
        
    - New middlemen emerge, but their leverage is lower.
        
    

> Once replication cost hits zero, scarcity is no longer a fact — it’s a choice enforced by law and gatekeeping.
