# (define (think x)

Most people think linearly. Problem → solution. Step 1, step 2, step 3.

But the most elegant solutions come from **recursive thinking**—breaking problems down until they become trivial, then building back up.

## The Pattern

```lisp
(if (atomic? x)
    x
    (map think (simplify (decompose x))))
```

**If the problem is simple enough** → solve it directly  
**If not** → break it down, simplify each piece, solve recursively

## Real Examples

### Code Architecture
**Linear thinking**: "How do I build this feature?"  
**Recursive thinking**: "What's the smallest unit that composes into this feature?"

Result: Components that work together vs. monolithic spaghetti.

### Learning
**Linear thinking**: "I need to learn React"  
**Recursive thinking**: "What are the atomic concepts that compose into React mastery?"

Result: (components → state → effects → patterns) instead of tutorial hell.

### Business Problems
**Linear thinking**: "How do I get more users?"  
**Recursive thinking**: "What atomic value creates compound growth?"

Result: Focus on the function that generates users, not just user acquisition.

## Why This Works

1. **Forces clarity** - you can't recurse on unclear problems
2. **Finds reusable patterns** - atomic solutions compose into bigger solutions  
3. **Prevents over-complexity** - if it doesn't decompose cleanly, it's probably wrong

## The Practice

Next time you hit a complex problem:

1. **Decompose** - what are the real sub-problems?
2. **Simplify** - what's the essence of each piece?
3. **Recurse** - apply the same process to each piece
4. **Compose** - build the solution from atomic parts

*Complexity is just poorly decomposed simplicity.*

**Input** → **(think x)** → **Output**
