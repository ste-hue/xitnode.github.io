## Writing Style

Write as if these are architecture notes written mid-build.

Prioritize clarity under stress over elegance.

Assume the reader is intelligent but busy.

State constraints, assumptions, and tradeoffs explicitly.

Describe systems in terms of components, flows, and failure modes.

Explain *why* choices were made, including what was rejected and why.

Do not persuade. Do not motivate. Do not perform.

Avoid grand claims, emotional framing, and rhetorical padding.

Prefer plain language, short sentences, and precise terms.

Use structure only where it reduces ambiguity.

If a sentence does not increase understanding of how the system holds or breaks, remove it.

Write to make the system maintainable, not to earn approval.
